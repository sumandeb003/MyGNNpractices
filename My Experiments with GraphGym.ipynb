The aggregated results over all the random seeds are automatically generated into `GraphGym/run/results/example/agg`, including the mean and standard deviation for each metric. `Train`/`val`/`test` results are further saved into subdirectories, such as `GraphGym/run/results/example/agg/val`, `GraphGym/run/results/example/agg/train` etc.; here, `stats.json` stores the results after each epoch aggregated across random seeds, `best.json` stores the results at the epoch with the highest validation accuracy.\n"
