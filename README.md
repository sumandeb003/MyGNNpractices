## Neural Message Passing

1. A graph contains nodes and edges. Nodes have embeddings -- features and values of the features.  
2. Graphs can't be plotted in co-ordinate space for classification by drawing decision boundary.
3. Our goal is to ***assign meaningful co-ordinates*** to the nodes of a graph so that we can then ***easily*** create decision boundaries across the nodes for classification rather than having to draw complicated boundaries.
